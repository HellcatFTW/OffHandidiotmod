A very basic mod I made with zero C# knowledge entirely using chatgpt.

Put a weapon in slot 5 of your hotbar, and when you right click, it will use that weapon.

Does not work if inventory is open, to preserve RMB functionality for treasure bags and such.

A custom UI slot for this is planned if chatgpt can manage it.
